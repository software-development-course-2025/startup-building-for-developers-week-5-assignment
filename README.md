# Blockchain-powered Payments for SMEs in Emerging Markets 🏆

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete documentation, pitch deck, and strategy for a fintech solution leveraging the Cardano blockchain to solve critical payment inefficiencies for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in emerging markets.

Our solution focuses on providing **instant, low-fee, and transparent payment processing**, eliminating the reliance on slow, costly, and opaque traditional banking systems.

## The Problem We Solve
SMEs in high-growth markets are held back by:
* **High Transaction Fees:** Leading to reduced profit margins.
* **Delayed Settlements:** Causing cash flow problems (2–5 days for settlement).
* **Lack of Transparency:** Difficulties in tracking funds and ensuring security.

## The Solution: The Instant, Low-Fee Payment Bridge
We built a robust payment system using smart contracts on the Cardano network, offering:
* **Instant Finality:** Payments completed in seconds.
* **Ultra-Low Fees:** Drastically reducing operational costs for merchants (0.5%–1% fee).
* **Dedicated Tools:** Clean Merchant and Customer Apps, plus API/SDK for easy integration with POS and e-commerce platforms.

## Business & Social Impact
We are targeting a Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) of **$500M** within a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of **$50B+**. Beyond profit, our mission is to drive **financial inclusion** (SDG 10) and support **Decent Work and Economic Growth** (SDG 8) by making commerce fair and efficient for local businesses.
